		<h1>...more like a bible...</h1>

		<p>My name is Marlene Lopez (she/her), and I am from SoCal. I am a fourth year student at UCSC studying AGPM and Psychology. I am obsessed with food like the true fatass that I am, and I like trying new recipes and can bake up a storm. munch munch crunch crunch. But when I am not eating, I am either reading manga or forcing myself to leave the house and do some physical acitivity: rock climbing or pushing on a skateboard. I also like cracking dad jokes, so watch out. And I love having self-care days with face masks and fun or sadboi music. </p>
