		<h3>Blerb about me...more like a bible...</h3>

		<p>My name is Marlene Lopez (she/her), and I am from SoCal. I am a fourth year student at UCSC studying AGPM and Psychology. I am not a pro at programming but I hope that with this class I can help build the foundation to change that. Fingers-crossed I can work at Webtoons in the future hopefully animating trailers for my favorite manga.</p>

		<p>Random tid bits about me are I am obsessed with food like the true fatass that I am, and I like trying new recipes and can bake up a storm. munch munch crunch crunch.When I am not eating, I am either reading manga or forcing myself to leave the house to do some physical acitivity: rock climbing or pushing on a skateboard. I also like cracking dad jokes almost as much as I love having self-care days with face masks and fun or sadboi music.</p>
