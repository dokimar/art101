	<h2>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and problem-solving</h2>

	<!-- lab task 4 -->
	<div id="challenges">
		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>The main challenge we faced was getting all of the formatting correct
			and making sure the code was well commented so that it could be easily
			understood. Also, since there were a lot of steps and different programs
			(Atom files, broswer windows, .DOC file) to keep track of, making sure
		 	every location was updated and had the correct items was a challenge.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="problems">
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>One problem we had was the amount of windows and files to juggle.
			What with needing to have a fleshed out index.html and lab.js files, as well as maintaining the submission .PDF, making sure everyhing had what was required by the intructions made the process feel a bit hectic.</p>
		<p>We also had some slight issues with communication and timing as Marlene
			had an appointment run overtime, as well as other more complicated issues
			happening in real life. However, we were able to get over them for the
			most part and complete the lab on time.</p>
		<p>There also seemed to be a general issue with pushing to GitHub sites, as
			brought up by Pete in section where some students were locked out of their
			files because GitHub had flagged them. Because of that, we are being more
			cautious and are going to wait to push from local files to GitHub to make
			sure that nothing goes wrong.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>Below are the two outlines we made for the first two tasks in the lab:
			Task 1 is an everyday task, and Task 2 is a computer task.</p>

		<p>Task 1 was written in this index.html file first, and then copied into
			the submission .DOC:</p>

	      </ol>
	    </div>

		<p>Task 2 was written in the submission .DOC file first, before being copied
			into /js/lab.js and turned into a comment block:</p>

			<!-- lab tasks 2+3 -->
			<div id="task 2">
				<h4>Task 2 and 3: Pseudocode a computer task</h4>
				<!-- use the outline from submission doc -->
				<h5>Computer Task: Calculate Student Total Grade</h5>

				<!-- '<pre>' and '<code>' indicate 'preferred format: code'
				which preserves indents and paragraph spacing -->
				<pre><code><!-- from lab4/js/lab.js inital outline -->
		//Read grade categories (e.g. final, project, quizzes) and base
		//Accept user input of student actual grades
				//Calculate final, final max, final weight
