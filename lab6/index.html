		<h2>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h2>

		<!-- task 3 -->
		<div id="challenges">
			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>One small challenge we faced was getting the syntax correct when using the console. There were some commands that didn't work the first time when trying to declare some components of the myMainRide object.</p>
			<p>Another challenge was formatting the myTransport array when printing. We ended up calling each array element to be printed individually with hand-written spacing between elements because the example statement in the assignment did not add spaces when called with <i>document.writeln()</i>.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="problems">
			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p>When using the console, we saw that the <b>name:</b><i>value</i> pair of "year" had to be defined in the myMainRide object before the "year"
		 	number could be called as <i>myMainRide.year</i> to calculate the car's
			"age". Therefore, just in case, we defined the "year" when declaring the
			myMainRide object, and defined the "age" calculation separately.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="results">
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Below is the printed results of the lab.js file. It first prints out
			 the myTransport array in a list form, and then it prints out the data
		 	 held in the myMainRide object:</p>
